# Withdraw Vesting Routes Guide

This guide is intended for use by individuals whose accounts were compromise and vesting route set to the hacker's account. The vesting route controls which account receives the funds once a 'power down' is initiated. 

To check if you have a vesting route in place, pull up your account on steemd and find "Withdraw routes" in the left column. If the number beside it is anything other than 0, you need to follow the next steps.

# FAQ

#### Why can't I use SteemConnect?  
Because it doesn't have the *setWithdrawVestingRoute* functionality implemented yet, so it won't work.

If you get this error, log out and back in using the app itself, not the SteemConnect option.

#### Does @good-karma really take 25%?  
No, that's just my example I set up. The wallet DID NOT come like this.

#### Is the eSteem Surfer a trusted app?

Yes. It was created in good faith by @good-karma and the code is on GitHub, open to anyone who wishes to examine and validate it. Explore all the app's features on your own.
